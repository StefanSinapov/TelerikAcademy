##Arrays##
1. Write a script that allocates array of 20 integers and initializes each element by its index multiplied by 5. Print the obtained array on the console.
* Write a script that compares two char arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).
* Write a script that finds the maximal sequence of equal elements in an array.
	- Example: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, `2, 2, 2,` 1} ïƒ  {2, 2, 2}.
* Write a script that finds the maximal increasing sequence in an array. 
	- Example: {3, `2, 3, 4,` 2, 2, 4} -> {2, 3, 4}.
* Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a script to sort an array. Use the "selection sort" algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.
	Hint: Use a second array
* Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array. 
	- Example: {`4`, 1, 1, `4`, 2, 3, `4`, `4`, 1, 2, 4, 9, 3} -> 4 (5 times)
* Write a program that finds the index of given element in a sorted array of integers by using the binary search algorithm (find it in Wikipedia).
