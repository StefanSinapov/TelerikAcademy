1. Take the VS solution `Abstraction` and refactor its code to provide good abstraction. Move the properties and methods from the class Figure to their correct place. Move the common methods to the base class's interface. Remove all duplicated code (properties / methods / other code).
* Establish good encapsulation in the classes from the VS solution `Abstraction`. Ensure that incorrect values cannot be assigned in the internal state of the classes.
* Take the VS solution `Cohesion-and-Coupling` and refactor its code to follow the principles of good abstraction, loose coupling and strong cohesion. Split the class Utils to other classes that have strong cohesion and are loosely coupled internally.
* Redesign the classes and refactor the code from the solution `Inheritance-and-Polymorphism` to follow the best practices in high-quality classes. Extract abstract base class and move all common properties in it. Encapsulate the fields and make sure required fields are not left without a value. Reuse the repeating code though base methods.
