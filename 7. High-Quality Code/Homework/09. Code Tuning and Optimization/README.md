## 09. Code Tuning and Optimization

1. You are given a C# application (`Code-Tuning-and-Optimization-Homework.zip`) which displays an animated 3D model of the Solar system.
    - Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (`bottlenecks`).
        - Provide a `screenshot` of the profilerâ€™s result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides (name of the file, line of code).
    - Make a `quick fix` in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance. `Test the code` after the fix for correctness + performance.
* Write a program to `compare the performance` of add, subtract, increment, multiply, divide for `int`, `long`, `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.
* Write a program to `compare the performance` of square root, natural logarithm, sinus for `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.
* *Write a program to `compare the performance` of insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort for `int`, `double` and `string` values. Check also the following cases: random values, sorted values, values sorted in reversed order.
