## Numeral Systems

1. Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their binary representation.
* Write a program to convert binary numbers to their decimal representation.
* Write a program to convert decimal numbers to their hexadecimal representation.
* Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to their decimal representation.
* Write a program to convert hexadecimal numbers to binary numbers (directly).
* Write a program to convert binary numbers to hexadecimal numbers (directly).
* Write a program to convert from any numeral system of given base `s` to any other numeral system of base `d` (2 ≤ `s`, `d` ≤  16).
* Write a program that shows the binary representation of given 16-bit signed integer number (the C# type `short`).
* \* Write a program that shows the internal binary representation of given 32-bit signed floating-point number in IEEE 754 format (the C# type `float`). Example: -27,25 -> sign = 1, exponent = 10000011, mantissa = 10110100000000000000000.
