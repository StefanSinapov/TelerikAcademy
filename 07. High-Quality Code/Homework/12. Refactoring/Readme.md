## Refactoring

Refactor the C# code from "[homework.zip](https://github.com/flextry/Telerik-Academy/blob/master/Programming%20with%20C%23/4.%20C%23%20High-Quality%20Code/12.%20Refactoring/Refactoring-Homework.zip)" to improve its internal quality. You might follow the following steps:

1. Make some initial refactorings like:
    * Reformat the code.
    * Rename the ugly named variables.
* Make the code testable.
    * Think how to test console-based input / output.
* Write unite tests. Fix any bugs found in the mean time.
* Refactor the code following the guidelines from this chapter. Do it step by step. Run the unit tests after each major change.
