## 03. Trees and Traversals

1. You are given a `tree of N nodes` represented as a set of N-1 pairs of nodes (parent node, child node), each in the range (0..N-1).
 Example:
	7
	2 4
	3 2
	5 0
	3 5
	5 6
	5 1

	Write a program to read the tree and find:
	- the root node
	- all leaf nodes
	- all middle nodes
	- the longest path in the tree
	- \* all paths in the tree with given sum S of their nodes
	- \* all subtrees with given sum S of their nodes
* Write a program to traverse the directory `C:\WINDOWS` and all its subdirectories recursively and to display all files matching the mask `*.exe`. Use the class `System.IO.Directory`.
* Define classes `File { string name, int size }` and `Folder { string name, File[] files, Folder[] childFolders }` and using them build a tree keeping all files and folders on the hard drive starting from `C:\WINDOWS`. Implement a method that calculates the sum of the file sizes in given subtree of the tree and test it accordingly. Use recursive DFS traversal.
