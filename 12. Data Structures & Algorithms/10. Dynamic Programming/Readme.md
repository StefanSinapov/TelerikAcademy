## 10. Dynamic Programming

1. Write a program based on dynamic programming to solve the "Knapsack Problem": you are given N products, each has weight W i and costs C i and a knapsack of capacity M and you want to put inside a subset of the products with highest cost and weight -> M. The numbers N, M, W i and C i are integers in the range [1..500]. Example: M=10 kg, N=6, products:
	- beer – weight=3, cost=2
	- vodka – weight=8, cost=12
	- cheese – weight=4, cost=5
	- nuts – weight=1, cost=4
	- ham – weight=2, cost=3
	- whiskey – weight=8, cost=13
	|-----------------------|
	|	Optimal Solution	|
	|-----------------------|
	|	nuts + whiskey		|
	|	weight = 9			|
	|	cost = 17			|
	|-----------------------|
* Write a program to calculate the "Minimum Edit Distance" (MED) between two words. MED(x, y) is the minimal sum of costs of edit operations used to transform x to y. Sample costs are given below:
	- cost (replace a letter) = 1
	- cost (delete a letter) = 0.9
	- cost (insert a letter) = 0.8
	- Example:
		- delete ‘d’:  "developer" -> "eveloper", cost = 0.9
		- insert ‘n’:  "eveloper" -> "enveloper", cost = 0.8
		- replace ‘r’ -> ‘d’:  "enveloper" -> "enveloped", cost = 1
