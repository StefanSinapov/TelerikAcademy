## 06. Data Structure Efficiency

1. A text file students.txt holds information about students and their courses in the following format:
	```
		Kiril  | Ivanov   | C#
		Stefka | Nikolova | SQL
		Stela  | Mineva   | Java
		Milena | Petrova  | C#
		Ivan   | Grigorov | C#
		Ivan   | Kolev    | SQL
	```
	Using `SortedDictionary<K,T>` print the courses in alphabetical order and for each of them prints the students ordered by family and then by name:
	```
		C#: Ivan Grigorov, Kiril Ivanov, Milena Petrova
		Java: Stela Mineva
		SQL: Ivan Kolev, Stefka Nikolova
	```
* A large trade company has millions of articles, each described by barcode, vendor, title and price. Implement a data structure to store them that allows fast retrieval of all articles in given price range [x…y]. 
	Hint: use `OrderedMultiDictionary<K,T>` from [Wintellect's Power Collections for .NET](http://powercollections.codeplex.com/). 
* Implement a class `BiDictionary<K1,K2,T>` that allows adding triples {`key1, key2, value}` and fast search by `key1`, `key2` or by both key1 and key2. 
	Note: multiple values can be stored for given key.
