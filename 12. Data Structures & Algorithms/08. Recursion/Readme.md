## Recursion

1. Write a recursive program that simulates the execution of **n nested loops** from 1 to n. Examples:

    ```
                               1 1 1
                               1 1 2
                               1 1 3
             1 1               1 2 1
    n = 2->  1 2      n = 3 -> ...
             2 1               3 2 3
             2 2               3 3 1
                               3 3 2
                               3 3 3
    ```
* Write a recursive program for generating and printing all the **combinations with duplicates** of k elements from n-element set.
    - Example: `n = 3, k = 2 -> (1 1), (1 2), (1 3), (2 2), (2 3), (3 3)`
* Modify the previous program to **skip duplicates**:
    - Example: `n = 4, k = 2 -> (1 2), (1 3), (1 4), (2 3), (2 4), (3 4)`
* Write a recursive program for generating and printing all **permutations** of the numbers 1, 2, ..., n for given integer number n.
    - Example: `n = 3 -> { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1, 3, 2 }, { 2, 1, 3 }, { 2, 3, 1 }, { 3, 1, 2 },{ 3, 2, 1 }`
* Write a recursive program for generating and printing all ordered k-element subsets from n-element set **(variations V<sup>k</sup><sub>n</sub>)**.
    - Example: `n = 3, k = 2, set = { hi, a, b } -> (hi hi), (hi a), (hi b), (a hi), (a a), (a b), (b hi), (b a), (b b)`
* Write a program for generating and printing all **subsets of k strings** from given set of strings.
    - Example: `s = { test, rock, fun }, k = 2 -> (test rock),  (test fun),  (rock fun)`
* We are given a matrix of passable and non-passable cells. Write a recursive program for finding all paths between two cells in the matrix.
* Modify the above program to check whether a path exists between two cells without finding all possible paths. Test it over an empty 100 x 100 matrix.
* Write a recursive program to find the largest connected area of adjacent empty cells in a matrix.
* \* We are given a matrix of passable and non-passable cells. Write a recursive program for finding all areas of passable cells in the matrix.
* \* Write a program to generate all permutations with repetitions of given multi-set. For example the multi-set `{ 1, 3, 5, 5 }` has the following 12 unique permutations:

    ```
        { 1, 3, 5, 5 }  { 1, 5, 3, 5 }
        { 1, 5, 5, 3 }  { 3, 1, 5, 5 }
        { 3, 5, 1, 5 }  { 3, 5, 5, 1 }
        { 5, 1, 3, 5 }  { 5, 1, 5, 3 }
        { 5, 3, 1, 5 }  { 5, 3, 5, 1 }
        { 5, 5, 1, 3 }  { 5, 5, 3, 1 }
    ```
    Ensure your program efficiently avoids duplicated permutations. Test it with `{ 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 }`.
