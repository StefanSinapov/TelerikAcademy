## 02. ASP.NET Web API

1. Using ASP.NET Web API create REST services for the Student System demo from Code First presentation in the Databases course. Use high-quality code, use Repository pattern and create services for all available models. Do not use scaffolding. 
* Using ASP.NET Web API and Entity Framework (database first or code first) create a database and web services with full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations for hierarchy of following classes: 
	- Artists (Name, Country, DateOfBirth, etc.) 
	- Albums (Title, Year, Producer, etc.) 
	- Songs (Title, Year, Genre, etc.) 
	- Every album has a list of artists 
	- Every song has artist 
	- Every album has list of songs
* Create console application and demonstrate the use of all service operations using the HttpClient class (with both JSON and XML) 
* \* Create JavaScript-based single page application and consume the service to display user interface for: 
	- Creating, updating and deleting artists, songs and albums (with cascade deleting) 
	- Show pageable, sortable and filterable artists, songs and albums using OData
