# ASP.NET Web Forms Teamwork
Teamwork assignment for the ASP.NET Web Forms course at Telerik Academy.

## Project Description
Design and implement a **data-driven ASP.NET Web Forms application**. It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other Web application by your choice.
The application should have **public part** (accessible without authentication), **private part** (available for registered users) and **administrative part** (available for administrators only).

## General Requirements
Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
- Use **ASP.NET 4.5** Web Forms and **Visual Studio 2013**
- Your UI should use **server-side Web Forms** UI rendering (ASPX pages and ASCX controls)
    - ASP.NET MVC and JavaScript UI controls are not allowed
- Use **MS SQL Server** as database back-end
- Use **Entity Framework** to access your database
- Use **data-binding** technique by choice. You are free to use data-source controls (like **EntityDataSource** and **ObjectDataSource**), model binding or manual binding in the C# code behind pages.
- Use at least **two data grids** (table-like data UI components) with **server-side paging** and **sorting**
- Adapt the **default ASP.NET Web site template** from Visual Studio 2013
    - Use responsive design based on **Twitter Bootstrap**
    - You may change the standard theme and modify it to apply own web design and visual styles
- Use a **Master page** to define the common UI for the public, private and administrative parts
- Use **Sitemap** and navigational UI controls to implement site navigation
- Use the standard **ASP.NET Identity System** for managing users and roles
    - Your registered users should have are least two roles: **user** and **administrator**
- Use the standard ASP.NET Web Forms controls (from **System.Web.UI**)
    - External UI controls from Telerik / Infragistics / DevExpress / etc. are **not allowed**
- Use **UpdatePanels** and **AJAX** where applicable to avoid full postbacks
- Apply **error handling** and **data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered
- Handle correctly the **special HTML characters** and tags like **<br />**
- Use at least **two ASCX user controls** that encapsulate some functionality
- Use at least one **file upload** form to send files at the server side (e.g. profile photos for your users)
