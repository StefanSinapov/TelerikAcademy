## 13. User Controls

1. Create a user control that visualizes a menu of links. The control should have a property to initialize the menu links (a list of items, each containing a title and URL). Use `DataList` and data binding to visualize the menu links. Implement a property to change the font and the font color. Don’t use the `Menu` control!
2. \* Create a custom control to display an analog clock based on the HTML 5 canvas (you could take some code from [http://randomibis.com/coolclock/](http://randomibis.com/coolclock/)). Define a property to change the time zone. All control assets (CSS, images, scripts, etc.) should be loaded dynamically at runtime when the control is rendered.
