This book covers the fundamentals of programming that have not changed significantly over the last 10 years. Educational content was developed by an authoritative author team led by Svetlin Nakov and covers topics such as variables conditional statements, loops and arrays, and more complex concepts such as data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, etc.), and recursion recursive algorithms, object-oriented programming and high-quality code. From the book you will learn how to think as programmers and how to solve efficiently programming problems. You will master the fundamental principles of programming and basic data structures and algorithms, without which you can't become a software engineer.",
