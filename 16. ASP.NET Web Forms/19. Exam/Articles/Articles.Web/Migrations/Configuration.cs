It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &amp;amp;amp;quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&amp;amp;amp;quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
