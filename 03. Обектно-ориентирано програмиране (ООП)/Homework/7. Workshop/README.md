1. Create a ChaoticParticle class, which is a Particle, randomly changing its movement (Speed). You are not allowed to edit any existing class.
* Test the ChaoticParticle through the ParticleSystemMain class
* Create a ChickenParticle class. The ChickenParticle class moves like a ChaoticParticle, but randomly stops at different positions for several simulation ticks and, for each of those stops, creates (lays) a new ChickenParticle. You are not allowed to edit any existing class.
* Test the ChickenParticle class through the ParcticleSystemMain class.
* Implement a ParticleRepeller class. A ParticleRepeller is a Particle, which pushes other particles away from it (i.e. accelerates them in a direction, opposite of the direction in which the repeller is). The repeller has an effect only on particles within a certain radius (see Euclidean distance)
* Test the ParticleRepeller class through the ParticleSystemMain class
