## 07. Working with third-party APIs

1. Create an “Online Map Tourism” application using Google maps
	* Choose 10 capital cities from the world
	* Make two buttons for “Next” and “Previous” which should iterate through the cities
	* When one of the buttons is clicked, map should pan to the new location of the new city
	* Each city should have `InfoBox` with more information about it on the map
	* Show lists of the cities on the page. If the user chooses a city, the map should pan directly to it
2. \*Read about the Google+ JavaScript API
3. \*Combine Google+ and YouTube APIs
	* If the user logins with Google+ the player should show, otherwise it should be hidden
	* When the user logs, his profile picture should be shown
	* Create custom controls for the video – pause, stop, load by id, load playlist, next, previous, mute, unmute, set volume, playback quality options
	* Add options to share the current video on Google+
