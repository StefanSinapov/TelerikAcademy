1. Create a simple number guessing game
	* The computer generates a random number with four different digits
		* The leftmost digit must not be 0 (zero)
		* For simplicity called abcd
	* At each turn the player enters a four-digit number
		* For simplicity called xyzw
	* When the game ends:
		* Ask the player for a nickname
		* Save the nickname inside the localStorage
	* Implement a high-score list
	* Sheep means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd, but not on the same position
		* If two such digits exists, the sheep are 2
	* Ram means that a digit from xyzw is contained in abcd and it is on the same position
		* If two such digits exists, the rams are 2
	* The game continues until the player guesses the number abcd
		* i.e. has 4 rams
