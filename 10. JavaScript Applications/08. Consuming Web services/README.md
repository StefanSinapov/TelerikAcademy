## 08. Consuming Web services

1. Create a module that exposes methods for performing HTTP requests by given URL and headers
    * `getJSON` and `postJSON`
    * Both methods should work with promises
2. Read the developer documentation of Twitter
    * Create a simple application that visualizes all public tweets for a given user (maybe from a textbox)
3. Using the REST API at 'localhost:3000/students' create a web application for managing students
    * The REST API provides methods as follows:
        * POST creates a new student
        * GET returns all students
        * DELETE deletes a student by Id
    * You may extend the demo for jQuery.ajax()
