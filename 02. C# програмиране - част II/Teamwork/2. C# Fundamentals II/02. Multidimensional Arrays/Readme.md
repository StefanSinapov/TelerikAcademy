## Multidimensional Arrays

1. Write a program that fills and prints a matrix of size `N`x`N` as shown below: (examples for N = 4)

2. Write a program that reads a rectangular matrix of size `N`x`M` and finds in it the square 3x3 that has maximal sum of its elements.
* We are given a matrix of strings of size `N`x`M`. **Sequences in the matrix** we define as sets of several neighbor elements located on the same line, column or diagonal. Write a program that finds the longest sequence of equal strings in the matrix. Example:

4. Write a program, that reads from the console an array of `N` integers and an integer `K`, sorts the array and using the method `Array.BinarySearch()` finds the largest number in the array which is <= K.
* You are given an array of strings. Write a method that sorts the array by the length of its elements (the number of characters composing them).
* \* Write a class **Matrix** to hold a matrix of integers. Overload the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying of matrices, indexer for accessing the matrix content and `ToString()`.
* \* Write a program that finds the largest area of equal neighbor elements in a rectangular matrix and prints its size. Example:

Hint: you can use the algorithm "Depth-first search" or "Breadth-first search".
