## 14. XML Basics

1. What does the XML language represents? What does it used for? 
* Create XML document `students.xml`, which contains structured description of students. For each student you should enter information for his name, sex, birth date, phone, email, course, specialty, faculty number and a list of taken exams (exam name, tutor, score).
* What does the namespaces represents in the XML documents? What are they used for? 
* Explore [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier}(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) to learn more about URI, URN and URL definitions.
* Add default namespace for the students "`urn:students`".
* Create XSD Schema for the students.xml document. Add new elements in the schema: information for enrollment (date and exam score) and teacher's endorsements.
* Write a XSL stylesheet to visualize the students as HTML. Test it in your favourite browser.
