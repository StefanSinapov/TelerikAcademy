## 02. SQL Server and MySQL

1. Download and install SQL Server Express. Install also SQL Server Management Studio Express (this could take some effort but be persistent).
* Connect to the SQL Server with SQL Server Management Studio. Use Windows authentication.
* Create a new database `Pubs` and create new login with permissions to connect to it. Execute the script `install_pubs.sql` to populate the DB contents (you may need slightly to edit the script before).
* Attach the database `Northwind` (use the files `Northwind.mdf` and `Northwind.ldf`) to SQL Server and connect to it.
* Backup the database Northwind into a file named `northwind-backup.bak` and restore it as database named North.
* Export the entire Northwind database as SQL script. Use [Tasks] -> [Generate Scripts]. Ensure you have exported table data rows (not only the schema).
* Create a database `NW` and execute the script in it to create the database and populate table data.
* Detatch the database `NW` and attach it on another computer in the training lab. In case of name collision, preliminary rename the database.
* Download and install MySQL Community Server  + MySQL Workbench + the sample databases.
* Export the MySQL sample database `world` as SQL script.
* Modify the script and execute it to restore the database world as `worldNew`.
* Connect through the MySQL console client and list the first 20 tons from the database `worldNew`.
