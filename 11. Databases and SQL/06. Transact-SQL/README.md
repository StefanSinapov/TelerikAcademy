## 06. Transact-SQL

1. Create a database with two tables: Persons(Id(PK), FirstName, LastName, SSN) and Accounts(Id(PK), PersonId(FK), Balance). Insert few records for testing. Write a stored procedure that selects the full names of all persons.
* Create a stored procedure that accepts a number as a parameter and returns all persons who have more money in their accounts than the supplied number.
* Create a function that accepts as parameters – sum, yearly interest rate and number of months. It should calculate and return the new sum. Write a SELECT to test whether the function works as expected.
* Create a stored procedure that uses the function from the previous example to give an interest to a person's account for one month. It should take the AccountId and the interest rate as parameters.
* Add two more stored procedures WithdrawMoney( AccountId, money) and DepositMoney (AccountId, money) that operate in transactions.
* Create another table – Logs(LogID, AccountID, OldSum, NewSum). Add a trigger to the Accounts table that enters a new entry into the Logs table every time the sum on an account changes.
* Define a function in the database TelerikAcademy that returns all Employee's names (first or middle or last name) and all town's names that are comprised of given set of letters. Example 'oistmiahf' will return 'Sofia', 'Smith', … but not 'Rob' and 'Guy'.
* Using database cursor write a T-SQL script that scans all employees and their addresses and prints all pairs of employees that live in the same town.
* \* Write a T-SQL script that shows for each town a list of all employees that live in it. Sample output:
	```sql
	Sofia -> Svetlin Nakov, Martin Kulov, George Denchev
	Ottawa -> Jose Saraiva
	…
	```
* Define a .NET aggregate function StrConcat that takes as input a sequence of strings and return a single string that consists of the input strings separated by ','. For example the following SQL statement should return a single string:
	```sql
	SELECT StrConcat(FirstName + ' ' + LastName)
	FROM Employees
	```
