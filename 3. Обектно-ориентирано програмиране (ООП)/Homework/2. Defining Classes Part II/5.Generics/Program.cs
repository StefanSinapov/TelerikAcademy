/*
 * 5.Write a generic class GenericList that keeps a list of elements of some parametric type T.
 * Keep the elements of the list in an array with fixed capacity which is given as parameter 
 * in the class constructor. Implement methods for adding element, accessing element by index, removing 
 * element by index, inserting element at given position, clearing the list, finding element by its value and ToString(). Check all input parameters to avoid accessing elements at invalid positions.
 * 
 * 6.Implement auto-grow functionality: when the internal array is full, create a new array 
 * of double size and move all elements to it.
 * 
 * 7.Create generic methods Min() and Max() for finding the minimal and maximal element in the GenericList.
 * You may need to add a generic constraints for the type T.
