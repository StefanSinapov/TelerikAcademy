* 3. Create a hierarchy Dog, Frog, Cat, Kitten, Tomcat and define 
* useful constructors and methods. Dogs, frogs and cats are Animals.
* All animals can produce sound (specified by the ISound interface).
* Kittens and tomcats are cats. All animals are described by age,
* name and sex. Kittens can be only female and tomcats can be only 
* male. Each animal produces a specific sound. Create arrays of 
* different kinds of animals and calculate the average age of each
* kind of animal using a static method (you may use LINQ).
